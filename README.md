# Venture Capital Opportunities with Deep Neural Networks


## Summary
This is a project to assess funding applications from startups to see if success could be predicted. 
Preprocessing necessitated OneHotEncoding to make all the variables usable by the neural network.
The model was tweaked to try and increase the accuracy metrics.
The trained models are then saved as h5 files.

## Preprocessing

Preprocessing is an important facet of machine learning with neural networks.

One Hot Encoding creates additional columns in the testing and training data corresponding to data not represented by integers or floats.
All the data needs to be numeric in order for machine learning to be able to use the data.
